## **`1.`** **What is Tailwind?**
<!-- Answer -->
> * Tailwind CSS is a `utility-first` **framework** that relies on small, pre-defined `utility classes` to style elements. Utility classes are specific styles that apply one particular property, such as text-center for centering text or bg-red-500 for adding a red background. This method enables you to quickly create designs by combining these utility classes right in your **HTML**, providing both speed and flexibility.
